The officially sanctioned way is now the iconutil command instead.

From Apple's guidelines:

After youâ€™ve created the necessary app icon assets, place them in folder a named icon.iconset. To create an .icns file, use iconutil in Terminal. Terminal is located in /Applications/Utilities/Terminal. Enter the command iconutil -c icns <iconset filename>, where <iconset filename> is the path to the .iconset folder. You must use iconutil, not Icon Composer, to create high-resolution .icns files.
There's another relevant Apple doc that goes more in depth: High Resolution Resources.
